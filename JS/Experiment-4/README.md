# Experiment 4 – Basic GraphQL API

## Aim

To create a basic GraphQL API using Node.js, Express, and `express-graphql`.

## Objective

To understand how GraphQL schemas, queries, and resolvers are created and used with an Express server.

## Technologies Used

* Node.js
* Express.js
* GraphQL
* express-graphql

## Main File

`exp4.js`

## Description

The program creates a GraphQL API with a `User` type and a `Query` type.

The API provides:

* A `hello` query
* A `users` query that returns user details

GraphiQL is enabled to test the API through a browser.

## How to Run

From the `JS` directory:

```bash
node Experiment-4/exp4.js
```

Open the following URL in the browser:

```text
http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

## Sample Query

```graphql
{
  hello
}
```

## Sample Users Query

```graphql
{
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

## Expected Result

The GraphiQL interface displays the requested GraphQL query results.

## Learning Outcome

This experiment demonstrates the basic implementation of a GraphQL API using Node.js and Express.
